# 3.0.0

- Full rewrite in Go.

# 2.1.0

- Added early return so `git num convert` without args does not invoke `git status` unnecessarily (useful for large repos when using aliases like `alias gd="git num diff"`)

# 2.0.1

- Added support for Git 1.7.9+.
- Fixed a bug where `git num convert abc123-456` would be interpreted as "abc"
  followed by a range.
- Added troubleshooting instructions to the README.

# 2.0.0

- git-num annotations will now always be ordered sequentially from top to
  bottom, even if one filename appears multiple times. (Previously the numbers
  would be based on a psuedo-alphabetical sort of the paths with duplicates
  being assigned the same number.) The new behavior is more intuitive and makes
  it easier to select ranges of files.
- Rather than naively wrapping filenames in double quotes (and escaping quotes
  in the filename, if any), git-num now escapes filenames using the native Ruby
  [shellwords library](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.2/libdoc/shellwords/rdoc/Shellwords.html).
- Git commands are now executed in a subshell, which prevents Git from
  complaining about broken pipes when exiting from a large diff. Fixes issue #5.
- Added `-v` version option.
- Substantial improvements were made to the unit and integration test suites.

# 1.1.0

- When executing a Git command, the Git process will now replace the git-num
  process. This has two effects: 1.) the user will see the output of commands
  that write to STDOUT (e.g. `git num reset HEAD` in some cases), and 2.)
  commands which read from STDIN will work as expected (e.g. `git num diff` and
  `git num add --patch`).

# 1.0.0

- Initial release
